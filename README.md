# ENGE817-Real-Time-Image-Classification-For-Spinach-Quality-On-Resource-Constraint-Devices
**This Repo contains three py files which are CNN.py, InceptionV3.py and  InceptionV3(low complexity).py; InceptionV3 includes 100% accuracy for the dataset of 1045 images of spinach, then InceptionV3(low complexity) which has been processed to reduce complexity and is therefore less accurate than the original InceptionV3.**

** These python code references the https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-image-classification-using-keras/, https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cnn-tensorflow-python, https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/transfer-learning-using-inception-v3-for-image-classification-86700411251b and https://www.indusmic.com/post/how-to-use-inception-model-for-image-recognition**
