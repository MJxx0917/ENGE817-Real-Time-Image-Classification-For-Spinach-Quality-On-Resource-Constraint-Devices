# ENGE817-Real-Time-Image-Classification-For-Spinach-Quality-On-Resource-Constraint-Devices
**This Repo contains three py files which are CNN.py, InceptionV3.py and  InceptionV3(low complexity).py; InceptionV3 includes 100% accuracy for the dataset of 1045 images of spinach, then InceptionV3(low complexity) which has been processed to reduce complexity and is therefore less accurate than the original InceptionV3.**
